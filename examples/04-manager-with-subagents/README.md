# 04 — Manager with Sub-Agents

A manager agent that orchestrates multiple worker agents in parallel, then synthesizes their results.

## What it does

A manager agent spawns three worker agents concurrently — each researching a different domain of AI in healthcare. Once all workers complete, the manager synthesizes the findings into a final report.

## Run it

```bash
# Apply the manager agent
kubectl apply -f manager.yaml

# Watch the manager (you'll see it spawn sub-agents)
komputer watch research-manager

# The manager creates workers automatically — list them
kubectl get komputeragents

# Or via the API
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/agents
```

## What gets created

When the manager runs, it creates sub-agents via the komputer.ai MCP tools. The platform:

1. Creates `KomputerAgent` CRs for each sub-agent
2. Automatically groups them under a `KomputerOffice`
3. The manager polls sub-agent status and reads their results

```bash
# See the office that gets auto-created
kubectl get komputeroffices
komputer office list
komputer office get research-manager
```

## How manager orchestration works

Managers have access to MCP tools:
- `create_agent` — spawn a sub-agent with instructions
- `get_agent` — check a sub-agent's status and last message
- `list_agents` — see all agents in the namespace

Workers get `Bash` and `WebSearch` only. Managers get the orchestration tools on top.

## Key concepts

- **`role: manager`** — enables the MCP orchestration tools
- **`KomputerOffice`** — auto-created group tracking manager + all its sub-agents
- **`claude-opus-4-7`** — use a more capable model for managers that need to reason and coordinate
- Sub-agents default to `role: worker` when spawned by a manager
- Managers can read sub-agent results from `/workspace` via shared naming conventions, or by reading the `lastTaskMessage` status field
