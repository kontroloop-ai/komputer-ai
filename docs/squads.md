# Squads

A squad is a named group of agents that share a single Kubernetes Pod, giving every member direct read/write access to each other's workspaces via the filesystem. The operator provisions one Pod per squad with all member containers and their PVCs mounted inside it — no coordination protocol, just shared files.

## When to use

Use a squad when agents need to exchange files directly:

- **Pair programming** — one agent writes code, another reviews or runs tests against the same files.
- **Pipeline workers** — an agent generates output files that the next agent in the chain reads.
- **Reviewer + coder** — one agent authors a diff, another applies feedback in place.

Do not use a squad when agents work on separate branches or unrelated tasks — solo agents are simpler and don't share resource lifecycle.

## Workspace layout

Inside the squad Pod each agent sees:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | The agent's own persistent workspace (its PVC) |
| `/agents/<sibling-name>/workspace` | Each sibling agent's workspace (read/write) |

All paths are read-write. There is no enforced isolation between members — any agent can write to a sibling's workspace.

## Lifecycle

### Creating a squad

- **UI** — New Agent dialog → Squad tab or Team Up tab.
- **CLI** — `komputer squad create --agents agent-a,agent-b`
- **API** — `POST /api/v1/squads`

The squad spec requires at least two members. Each member is either a `ref` (name of an existing agent) or an embedded `spec` (the operator creates the agent automatically and converts the entry to a ref on first reconcile).

### Adding a member to a running squad

Adding an agent to a squad that is already Running injects it as an **ephemeral container** — no Pod restart, existing members are unaffected.

CLI: `komputer squad add <squad> <agent>`
API: `POST /api/v1/squads/<name>/members`

### Removing a member

The removed agent's in-flight task is cancelled immediately. The container remains in the Pod until the next restart (Kubernetes cannot remove containers from a running Pod). The agent CR reverts to normal solo lifecycle on the next Pod restart.

CLI: `komputer squad remove <squad> <agent>`
API: `DELETE /api/v1/squads/<name>/members/<agent>`

### Empty squad — orphan TTL

When all members are removed the squad enters the `Orphaned` phase. After `orphanTTL` (default `10m`) the squad CR is deleted automatically. Set a custom TTL in the spec:

```yaml
spec:
  orphanTTL: 30m
```

### Single-member shrinkage

If a squad is reduced to exactly one member, it auto-dissolves: the squad Pod is deleted, the lone agent reverts to a solo Pod, and the squad CR is removed. No manual cleanup required.

## Limitations and caveats

- **One squad per agent.** An agent can belong to at most one squad at a time. This is enforced by an admission webhook — creating or patching a squad with an agent that is already in another squad is rejected.
- **Ephemeral container volume limitation.** When an agent is injected into a running Pod as an ephemeral container, Kubernetes does not allow adding new volumes to a running Pod. As a result the newly-added agent cannot mount its own PVC at `/workspace`. It *can* see all original members' workspaces at `/agents/<sibling>/workspace`. The agent's own `/workspace` becomes available after the next Pod restart (e.g. when another membership change triggers a recreate).
- **No resource requests for late-added members.** Ephemeral containers cannot declare resource requests/limits. Resources are only allocated on the next Pod restart when the agent becomes a regular container.
- **Pod name is the squad name.** `kubectl get pod` shows the squad Pod as `<squad-name>-pod`, not the individual agent names. Use `kubectl get pod <squad>-pod` to inspect it.

## GitOps

Members can be declared two ways in the squad CRD:

```yaml
spec:
  members:
    - ref:
        name: my-agent           # reference to an existing KomputerAgent
    - spec:                      # embedded spec — operator creates the agent
        task: "..."
```

**Prefer `ref` for GitOps.** When a member is declared with an embedded `spec`, the operator creates a `KomputerAgent` CR and rewrites the squad spec to a `ref` on first reconcile. This in-place mutation can surprise GitOps controllers (e.g. Argo CD, Flux) that detect drift. Declare agents separately and reference them by name to keep the squad spec stable.

## Manager tools

Manager agents can orchestrate squads using these MCP tools:

- `create_squad` — create a new squad
- `add_to_squad` — add an existing agent to a squad
- `remove_from_squad` — remove an agent from a squad
- `delete_squad` — delete a squad
- `list_squads` — list all squads

The `create_agent` tool also accepts an optional `squad` parameter to add the new agent to a squad immediately after creation.

## Configuration

The admission webhook that enforces membership uniqueness requires cert-manager. Enable or disable it in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
webhooks:
  enabled: true   # set to false if cert-manager is not available
```

When disabled, the one-squad-per-agent constraint is not enforced at admission time (the operator still handles conflicts, but errors surface later in the reconcile loop).
