description: How komputer.ai handles credentials — agent-specific Kubernetes Secrets injected as SECRET_* env vars.
---

Agents often need credentials to do their work — API keys, tokens, passwords. komputer.ai handles this through Kubernetes Secrets:

- When creating an agent, you can pass key-value secrets (e.g. `GITHUB=ghp_xxx`).
- The API creates a Kubernetes Secret and links it to the agent CR.
- The operator injects each key as a `SECRET_*` environment variable into the agent pod (e.g. `SECRET_GITHUB`).
- The agent's system prompt instructs Claude to check `SECRET_*` env vars when credentials are needed.
- When the agent is deleted, its secrets are automatically cleaned up via Kubernetes owner references.

Secrets from the template (like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and agent-specific secrets are merged at pod creation time. If there's a conflict, agent secrets take precedence.
